## Example Marlin Configuration
Made to work with Ender 3 V2 with offsets for [Satsana air duct](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4637453) and BL Touch probe connected to the BLTouch connector.

I'm not using this anymore since I switched to [Klipper](https://www.klipper3d.org/) with [MainsailOS](https://docs.mainsail.xyz/).
